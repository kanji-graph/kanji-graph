      <h4><b>Components</b> are groups of connected nodes in a graph. Think of them as islands of interconnected data.</h4>
      <br>
      <h4>In order to calculate the number of components in a given graph, we implemented the <b>breadth-first search</b> algorithm.</h4>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>In our large graph, there are <b>80 characters</b> yet only <b>7 components</b>.  Most of the nodes are linked to one large central component.  This conveys that most common japanese names are related combinations of the same small set of kanji.</h4>
      <br>
      <h4>We noticed that <b>田</b> (pronounced "ta", meaning "rice field") was by far the most connected datum in the large graph, occuring in 25 names -- a quarter of our sample. This perhaps speaks to Japan's heritage as an agrarian society.</h4>

    <br>
    <h4>We used <b>AJAX</b> to access information from the database in our Javascript layer. <b>D3.js</b> provides a built-in .json() function, which we used to access our own json endpoints.</h4>
    <br>
    <h4>Kanji definitions were dynamically scraped and seeded using <b>Nokogiri</b> and a custom <b>rake</b> task.</h4>
    <br>
    <h4>Our <b>javascript</b> is mostly procedural.  However, in order to implement the dynamic graph, we explored <b>object-oriented javascript</b>.  Each page load instantiates a Graph object, which maintains the state of the graph as nodes are added and removed.</h4>
    </br>
    <h4>We used <b>jQuery</b> to bind highlight and tooltip effects to each node's hover event.</h4>
    <br>
    <h4>The trusty <b>Rails stack</b> holds it all together.</h4>
